# Tutorial Overview

In this workshop, we'll be building a binary classification model to predict hospital readmission in patients with diabetes. A large focus will be on data pre-processing, which is a key part of the machine learning pipeline, and includes the following steps: 

- data cleaning
- exploratory data analysis
- feature engineering
- feature selection

We'll be using a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which includes patient and hospital outcome data from 130 U.S. hospitals collected from 1999 to 2008. 

### Requirements

Participants should know how to code in Python and be familiar with the standard data science libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).

### Dependencies

To run locally:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter notebook
- packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

To run on the cloud:
- Gmail account (to access Google Colab)
