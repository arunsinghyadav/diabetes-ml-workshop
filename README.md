# Building a Binary Classification ML Model to Predict Hospital Readmission in Patients with Diabetes

This is an introductory workshop to data science using Python. We'll be 
building a binary classification model to predict hospital readmission 
in patients with diabetes. A large focus will be on data pre-processing, 
which is a key part of the machine learning pipeline.

Key topics include:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data cleaning 
- Feature selection
- Supervised learning
- Binary classification
- Hyperparameter tuning  

We'll be using these packages to do our analysis:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Our [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008>) 
is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which includes patient and hospital outcome 
data from 130 U.S. hospitals collected from 1999 to 2008.

### Getting Started 

There are two options for setting up your environment:

1. On your local machine 
2. On the cloud using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LBth_Yk2jAyegg-elx9P7ljrYhojhe0z#scrollTo=7WEBheMIGcq7)

If you're relatively new to Python and programming, we highly recommend starting with the cloud option which doesn't require any setup. The only requirement is a Gmail account. 

If you decide to run the tutorial on your local machine, make sure that your environment is running on Python 3.6+ and has Jupyter notebook installed. You will need to install several pacakges which can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/topspinj/diabetes-ml-workshop/blob/master/requirements.txt).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
